# simple-banking-system
A simple banking system that works with sqlite3. A user is able to generate credit card numbers and pins that are stored in a database.
A user can log in and perform various actions including depositing an income and transfering an income to another account. The card
numbers follow the luhn algorithm, and if a user types a card number that doesn't follow the algorithm, they will be told to try again.
Made following Jetbrains Academy. Will be updated with features changed a little.
