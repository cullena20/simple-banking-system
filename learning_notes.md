# Learning Notes
This project was really fun to design. I was able to come up with the intial program pretty easily and able to apply much of what I have learned.
I am really becoming a better problem solver. The big thing I learned here was SQL. I learned about what databases such as SQL are for and how
to work with them. I learned to work with them within Python. I also learned about the luhn algorithms and the idea behind it. The code for this
project feels very messy. Can I make my own module working with sql and import it rather than having various SQL commands within the code? I will
try this in the future (working with my own modules in general). In the future I will try to have a better plan before I implement ideas of code 
to avoid unecessary work and unstructured code. (11/5/20)
